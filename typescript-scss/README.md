It offers more control over your code since it uses type annotations, interfaces, classes, and static type checking to throw errors at compile-time. TypeScript helps to enhance code quality and understandability, especially with a large codebase.

In this guide, I will lead you through TypeScript by learning first all the basics needed to start with this great language, and then finish up this article by building an app from scratch using HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.
